Testdata generator will let you generate test data for your data model. This is great when, for instance you have a separate back-end and front-end development team and the back-end developers are not done yet or the webserver an other team is building is not done. You as front-end developer could continue to develop you front-end by letting this framework fill your data model. It could also be useful when you want to develop outside the office and the database must remain there.
